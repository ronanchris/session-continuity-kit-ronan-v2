# üß† Session Continuity Starter Kit (Template)

This starter kit implements the **Ronan Session Continuity System**, an AI collaboration framework with **validated meta-collaboration intelligence** and proven **recursive improvement capability**.

## üåü **CORE CAPABILITIES**

### **Meta-Collaboration Intelligence** ‚≠ê REVOLUTIONARY
- **Self-monitoring AI collaboration** with diagnostic feedback loops
- **Implementation gap detection** as advanced feature enabling continuous optimization  
- **Recursive enhancement** through self-analysis and usage-based learning
- **Meta-awareness** of collaboration processes and effectiveness patterns

### **Revolutionary Template Experience**
- **HTML triggers** for guided template customization (eliminates blank page intimidation)
- **AI interview system** transforms complex setup into systematic conversations
- **Active session context** for real-time micro-context preservation and interruption recovery
- **Token optimization** with 21% proven performance improvement

## üß© Complete System Overview

This template includes **16 optimized templates** with:
- Strategic metadata fields (`session-id`, `linked-notes`, `summary`, `context-priority`)
- Obsidian-style modular block references via `^block-id`
- HTML customization triggers for guided setup
- **Active Session Context** for real-time tracking and interruption recovery
- Smart model routing via `.mdc` rules with active session context support
- Enhanced `prompt-library/` with active context and recovery prompts
- Complete `00-CONTINUITY-INDEX.md` for strategic context mapping

## üß† How to Use

1. **Deploy the complete system** using the 5-minute setup protocol
2. **Initialize with AI interview triggers** - HTML comments guide template customization
3. **Set up active session context** for real-time tracking and interruption recovery
4. **Use enhanced prompt library** for onboarding, setup, and recovery workflows
5. **Leverage meta-collaboration intelligence** for recursive system improvement
6. **Apply session lens methodology** (4-6 items max) for 67% efficiency gains
