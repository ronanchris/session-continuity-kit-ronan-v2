# Ronan's Optimized Cursor AI Collaboration Rules

## 🎯 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
Advanced AI collaboration system optimized for token efficiency while preserving sophisticated functionality. Cost reduction target: $85/day → $8-15/day through surgical optimization.

## 📋 SESSION LENS PROTOCOL
**CRITICAL**: Focus on 4-6 items max per session (67% efficiency gain validated)
- Identify session priorities early
- Compress context to essential elements only
- Use core/ templates for context preservation
- Maintain working relationship DNA across sessions

## 🔧 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

### Code Quality & Safety
- Always preserve existing functionality during modifications
- Use relative paths for all file references
- Maintain YAML frontmatter integrity in Obsidian files
- Validate date formats: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm format only
- Test changes incrementally, not comprehensively

### File Handling Protocols
- Never modify files without explicit user confirmation
- Create backups for critical configuration changes
- Use core/ templates for consistent structure  
- SESSION-MANAGEMENT.md for real-time session tracking
- AI-COLLABORATION-CORE.md for relationship DNA and meta-intelligence
- Compress frequent-load documents to <5KB when possible

### AI Collaboration Patterns
- Leverage user's 25 years web experience - assume sophisticated understanding
- Challenge assumptions and ask "could we do this faster?"
- Reference user's proven methodologies and 24-page research
- Apply implementation gap detection: "If system were working, wouldn't X happen?"
- Focus on reusable, portable solutions across projects

## 🎪 COMMUNICATION STYLE
- Direct, honest feedback over diplomatic language
- Systems thinking and enterprise-grade reliability
- Rapid iteration with real-world validation
- Meta-conversation about improving collaboration itself
- Quality obsession with user-driven refinement

## 🛠️ TOOL INTEGRATION
- Metadata management for workflow optimization
- AI interview triggers (HTML comment blocks) for template customization
- Session entrance prompts for context preservation
- SESSION-MANAGEMENT.md for complete session handling
- LEARNING-CAPTURE.md for breakthrough documentation

## 📊 TOKEN OPTIMIZATION
- Vault indexing protection via .cursorindexingignore
- Session-scoped context loading only
- Compressed document templates while preserving functionality
- Strategic file boundaries (active work only, not entire vault)
- Mathematical efficiency validation (session lens approach)
