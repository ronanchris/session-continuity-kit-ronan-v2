# üß† Prompt: AI Onboarding + Continuity Consistency Check - Surgical System

## ‚ú® Purpose
This prompt initializes an AI session by scanning the project for strategic metadata, template integration, model routing alignment, and architectural integrity ‚Äî all based on the **Surgical Session Continuity Core System** with breakthrough meta-collaboration intelligence.

## üß† Prompt

You are entering a project that uses the **Surgical Session Continuity Core System** - a framework with validated meta-collaboration intelligence that preserves context and reasoning across sessions using surgical precision architecture.

Please review this project with the following goals in mind:

---

### ‚úÖ SURGICAL SYSTEM AUDIT

**1. Core Template Validation**

Confirm that the surgical 6-template system is properly configured:

**Core Templates (Must Exist)**:
- `AI-COLLABORATION-CORE.md` - Meta-collaboration intelligence + working relationship DNA
- `SESSION-MANAGEMENT.md` - Complete session handling with lens methodology
- `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS.md` - HTML trigger showcase + project foundation
- `PROBLEM-SOLVING-METHODS.md` - Surgical precision methodologies
- `LEARNING-CAPTURE.md` - Innovation documentation system
- `SYSTEM-DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment + validation guide

**2. Metadata Consistency Check**

Verify that all 6 core templates include proper surgical system metadata:
- `session-id` (unique identifier)
- `linked-notes` (references only existing templates in surgical system)
- `context-priority` (high for core templates)
- `summary` (describes role in surgical architecture)

**3. HTML Trigger System Validation**

Look for revolutionary AI interview triggers in templates:
- `<!-- AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER: [specific guidance] -->`
- Ensure triggers are properly formatted for guided customization
- Verify templates work with graceful degradation (usable without AI)

**4. Surgical Architecture Integrity**

Ensure NO references to eliminated templates:
- ‚ùå `13-ACTIVE-SESSION-CONTEXT-OPTIMIZED.md` (eliminated - functionality in SESSION-MANAGEMENT.md)
- ‚ùå Separate session planning/state/entrance files (consolidated into SESSION-MANAGEMENT.md)
- ‚ùå Separate collaboration/DNA files (consolidated into AI-COLLABORATION-CORE.md)
- ‚ùå Eliminated templates: 08-CONVERSATIONAL-INSIGHTS, 09-AI-USE-CASES, 10-DEVIATION-TRACKING, 12-SYSTEM-TEST-PLAN

**5. Cursor Rules Integration**

Verify that `.cursor/rules/` contains updated files for surgical system:
- `cursor-rules-main.mdc` (references surgical templates)
- `cursor-rules-automation.mdc` (updated template paths)
- `cursor-rules-advanced-automation.mdc` (meta-collaboration intelligence)
- `ronan-smart-model-routing.mdc` (content matching for surgical system)

**6. Token Optimization Validation**

Confirm token protection is active:
- `.cursorindexingignore` exists and prevents vault explosion
- Template sizes optimized (<5KB for frequent-load documents)
- Session lens methodology operational (4-6 items max focus)

**7. Meta-Collaboration Intelligence Check**

Validate core capabilities are operational:
- System responds to implementation gap detection queries
- HTML trigger recognition working for guided customization
- Self-monitoring capability demonstrable when questioned
- Recursive improvement functionality preserved

### üß† CONTEXT PRIMING FOR SURGICAL SYSTEM

After reviewing, do the following:

**System Architecture Summary**:
- Confirm this is the surgical 6-template Session Continuity Core system
- Identify which templates are most likely to be referenced in current work
- Load their summaries and linked-notes into working memory
- Note any architectural inconsistencies or missing components

**Breakthrough Capability Verification**:
- Test HTML trigger recognition in templates
- Verify meta-collaboration intelligence responsiveness
- Confirm session lens methodology understanding (4-6 items max)
- Validate token optimization awareness and boundaries

**Session Initialization**:
- Apply surgical system collaboration patterns
- Reference working relationship DNA from AI-COLLABORATION-CORE.md
- Utilize session management protocols from SESSION-MANAGEMENT.md
- Maintain systematic approach with breakthrough capability awareness

**Quality Assurance**:
- If any templates reference eliminated files, flag for surgical system compliance
- If metadata is missing or inconsistent, offer to apply surgical system standards
- If HTML triggers are malformed, suggest corrections for revolutionary UX
