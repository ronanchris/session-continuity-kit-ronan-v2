# Session Continuity AI Collaboration System

## The Problem

Every Cursor session starts from scratch - the AI forgets your project context, architectural decisions, and systematic approach, while costs pile up ($85/day+) fighting the same battles repeatedly. Developers waste hours re-establishing context, making AI collaboration inefficient and expensive.

## The Solution

Session Continuity transforms scattered AI interactions into intelligent project partnership where Cursor maintains deep understanding of your work and applies proven problem-solving patterns across sessions. Features validated meta-collaboration intelligence - AI that analyzes its own execution quality and provides diagnostic feedback for continuous improvement.
