# üöÄ Quick Start: Try Session Continuity in 5 Minutes

## What This Does
Makes Cursor remember your project context between sessions, like having a conversation that continues where you left off instead of starting over every time.

## 5-Minute Test Drive

### Step 1: Token Protection (30 seconds)
```bash
# Copy this to your project root - prevents massive indexing overhead
# This single file can save you $50+ daily on heavy Cursor usage
curl -o .cursorindexingignore https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronanchris/session-continuity-kit-ronan-v2/main/.cursorindexingignore
```

#### **Config File Basics** (New to .cursorindexingignore? Read this!)
**Comment out lines**: Add `#` at start of any line to disable it
```bash
# node_modules/     ‚Üê This line is disabled
node_modules/       ‚Üê This line is active
```

**Test changes work**: Save file ‚Üí Restart Cursor ‚Üí Check response time improvement

**Revert safely**: Keep backup copy or use git to undo changes

**Troubleshooting**: If indexing breaks, comment out recent changes one by one until fixed

### Step 2: Try the Magic Template (2 minutes)
```bash
# Copy one template to experience the innovation
curl -o PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronanchris/session-continuity-kit-ronan-v2/main/core/PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS.md
```

### Step 3: Experience the Revolutionary UX (2 minutes)
1. **Open PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS.md in Cursor**
2. **Ask Cursor**: "Help me customize this template for my project"
3. **Watch the magic**: Template becomes a guided conversation instead of blank intimidation

### Step 4: See What Just Happened (30 seconds)
- ‚úÖ **Template intimidation eliminated** - No more blank page anxiety
- ‚úÖ **Guided setup experience** - AI walked you through systematic customization  
- ‚úÖ **Context preservation** - Cursor will remember this project context in future sessions
- ‚úÖ **HTML trigger system** - You just experienced revolutionary template innovation

## What You Just Experienced

### **Before Session Continuity**
- Open template ‚Üí Overwhelming blank document ‚Üí Don't know where to start
- Every Cursor session starts from scratch ‚Üí Repeat explanations constantly
- Complex setup processes ‚Üí Abandoned sophisticated tools

### **After Session Continuity** 
- Open template ‚Üí AI guides you through customization conversation
- Cursor remembers project context ‚Üí Continues where you left off
- Sophisticated setup made simple ‚Üí Actually use advanced collaboration

## Next Steps

curl -o core/LEARNING-CAPTURE.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronanchris/session-continuity-kit-ronan-v2/main/core/LEARNING-CAPTURE.md
curl -o core/SYSTEM-DEPLOYMENT.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ronanchris/session-continuity-kit-ronan-v2/main/core/SYSTEM-DEPLOYMENT.md
```
- Experience meta-collaboration intelligence (AI that improves itself)
- Get enterprise-grade systematic framework for serious project work
- Join community of practitioners using advanced AI collaboration

### **Level 3: Advanced Features** (1 hour)
- Copy complete .cursor/rules/ system for smart model routing
- Experience automatic AI model selection based on content complexity
- Set up cross-project intelligence preservation
- Contribute to community knowledge base

## Troubleshooting

### **HTML Triggers Not Working?**
- **Check**: Are you asking Cursor to help with template customization?
- **Try**: "Walk me through setting up this template" or "Help me customize this for my project"
- **Note**: Templates work perfectly even without triggers - they just become conversational when AI recognizes them

### **Cursor Rules Not Applied?**
- **Restart Cursor** after copying .cursorindexingignore
- **Check**: File is in project root, not subfolder
- **Verify**: Response times should improve after token protection activates

### **Not Seeing Context Preservation?**
- **Complete the template customization** - Context builds through systematic usage
- **Use for actual project work** - Context preservation shows value over multiple sessions
- **Reference templates in future sessions** - Ask Cursor to review your project requirements or session management

## Troubleshooting Model Routing

### AI Model Selection Diagnostics

#### Automatic Routing Not Working?
1. **Check YAML Metadata**
   - Ensure `context-priority: high` is set for strategic files
   - Verify metadata is correctly formatted

2. **Manual Model Selection**
   - Use chat command: "Use Claude 3 Opus for this file"
   - Explicitly specify desired AI model

3. **Routing Verification**
   - Open file in Cursor
   - Check AI model selected in top-right corner
   - Confirm matches expected model based on content/priority

#### Common Routing Rules
- High-priority files ‚Üí Claude 3 Opus
- Framework development ‚Üí Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- Critical architecture ‚Üí Claude 4 Sonnet
- Standard work ‚Üí Claude 3.5 Haiku
- Routine tasks ‚Üí Cursor Small

**Pro Tip**: When in doubt, use explicit model selection to ensure optimal AI assistance.
